                <p>I am an accomplished software-developer and software-architect with unique experience of having
                    worked in various domains in my career.
                    <br> At Google, I develop tools to benchmark datacenter networks and am involved in making GCP
                    faster and more reliable.
                    <br> At Cisco, I helped create infrastructure to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows
                    across switches and enabled the broadcast industry to move from SDI cable-based backend to IP-based
                    backend.
                    <br> At Texas Instruments, I verified Jacinto chipsets that have far ranging automotive and
                    industrial applications.
                    <br> While working for Nvidia, I verified the cache-coherency for the Uniform Virtual Memory that
                    was being used in multi-GPU chipsets.
